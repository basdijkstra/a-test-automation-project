# Setting up your development environment

Test automation is software development. That means that before you can even start to think about writing and running tests, you'll need to set up a development environment on your machine. This includes completing several steps.

### Setting up the Software Development Kit (SDK) for your language of choice

To be able to write and execute code, you'll need an SDK for the language of your choice. So, if you haven't decided on what language you are going to use for the project, this is the moment to do just that.

For most programming languages, setting up the SDK is fairly straightforward. You download the binaries, run an installer or perform the necessary installation instructions, and you should be good to go.

Here are some links to official SDK download sites for the most popular programming languages:

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [JavaScript (Node.JS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### What version of the SDK do I need?

Well, it depends :) The first and best choice is to ask around in your team or organization to check what version they are using. Then choose that.

If you don't get an answer to that question, your safest bet is to choose the latest [LTS (Long-term Support) version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support) for your language.

#### How do I know if the installation was successful?
